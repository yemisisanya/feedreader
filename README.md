# Jasmine - Feedreader Testing

This is udacity's front-end nanodegree project 5. It uses jasmine to test functionality of a feed reader website.

## How it Works
The test outlined in the feedreader.js file, is used to test the following:

RSS Feeds - It checks to see that feeds are defined and URL and names are not empty.

The Menu - It checks to see that the menu is hidden by default and when it is clicked, the menu is visible.

Initial Entries - It checks to see that atleast one entry is displayed.

New Feed Selection - It checks to see that feed content changes when a new feed is selected.
